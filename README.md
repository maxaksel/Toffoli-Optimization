# Context-Aware Native Gate-Level Optimization of the Toffoli Gate

This repository contains software and reports pertaining to context-aware native gate-level optimization of the Toffoli gate. Please see
the associated arXiv paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02669).
While the focus of this work is the Toffoli gate, the techniques explored are generalizable
to any quantum circuit.

A C++ version of this code supporting a subset of the features of this repository is available [here](https://github.com/maxaksel/QuOpt).
This code was used for numerical discovery 6-layer Toffoli gate structures over the {single qubit operations, FANOUT, CNOT} gate set.
