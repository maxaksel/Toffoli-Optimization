# Context-Aware Native Gate-Level Optimization of the Toffoli Gate

This repository contains software and reports pertaining to context-aware native gate-level optimization of the Toffoli gate.
While the focus of this work is the Toffoli gate, the techniques explored are generalizable
to any quantum circuit. 

This project is currently being documented in a MICRO submission.
